<h1>Bypass IP Ban on Discord</h1>
<p>This guide walks you through how to bypass an IP ban on Discord, whether you were banned from a server, globally banned from the platform, or just unable to create new accounts from your network. Follow each step carefully to start fresh without getting flagged again.</p>

<h2>Key Points</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Discord can issue IP bans after serious violations, alt abuse, or automated detection of ToS-breaking behavior.</li>
    <li>Even if you switch accounts, Discord may block your device if your IP, cookies, or system data match a previously banned session.</li>
    <li>This guide helps you bypass the ban by changing your IP, clearing stored identifiers, and setting up your client from scratch.</li>
</ul>

<h2>The Method: Mandatory Steps to Bypass Discord IP Bans</h2>
<p>Do the steps in order. Missing one can cause your new account to be flagged instantly, especially if Discord detects reused data.</p>

<h3>1. Changing Your IP Address</h3>
<p>Your IP address is a core part of Discord’s ban system. If it’s blocked, you won’t even be able to create or log into new accounts.</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Using a VPN:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Install a trusted, paid VPN with clean IP pools. Free VPNs are often blocked by Discord due to abuse.</li>
            <li>Connect to a new location and check your new IP using <a href="https://whatismyipaddress.com" target="_blank">whatismyipaddress.com</a>.</li>
            <li>Stay connected to this VPN server throughout the entire process.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Switching Networks:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Use mobile data, a public Wi-Fi network, or a hotspot to grab a fresh IP from another source.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Make sure to use a consistent IP when verifying or logging into your new Discord account, or you may get flagged again.</p>

<h3>2. Clearing App or Browser Data</h3>
<p>Discord stores a lot of identifiable info locally — cookies, session tokens, cached data, and app configs. You need to remove all of it.</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>On PC (browser):</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Go to your browser settings → Privacy → Clear browsing data.</li>
            <li>Clear cookies, site data, and cached files, especially for <code>discord.com</code>.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>On PC (desktop app):</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Close Discord completely.</li>
            <li>Go to <code>%AppData%\Discord</code> and delete the entire folder.</li>
            <li>Reboot your PC before reinstalling or logging back in.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>On Mobile:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Uninstall the Discord app.</li>
            <li>Reboot your phone and reinstall it after connecting to a new network or VPN.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Failure to clear local data is one of the most common reasons new accounts get instantly banned.</p>

<h3>3. Reinstalling Discord or Using Incognito Mode</h3>
<p>To prevent any old traces from returning, you should start with a fresh client or browser session.</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>On PC:</strong> Use incognito mode in your browser or a completely new browser profile. If using the app, install it only after step 2 is complete.</li>
    <li><strong>On Mobile:</strong> Only reinstall Discord once you’ve changed IPs and cleared data.</li>
</ul>

<h3>4. Creating a New Discord Account</h3>
<p>Discord tracks account history heavily. Creating a fresh account is your clean slate — but it has to be done the right way.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Use a brand new email or phone number that was never associated with a banned account.</li>
    <li>Do not reuse the same username, profile picture, bio, or server invites from your old account.</li>
    <li>Verify your new account using your new IP and VPN before joining public servers or chatting.</li>
</ul>

<h2>How It Works Together</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Step 1 (IP Change):</strong> Gives you a fresh network identity.</li>
    <li><strong>Step 2 (Data Clearing):</strong> Removes all stored flags, cookies, or identifiers that Discord can use to relink you.</li>
    <li><strong>Step 3 (Clean Reinstall or Incognito):</strong> Prevents hidden residuals from reloading banned data.</li>
    <li><strong>Step 4 (New Account):</strong> Starts fresh — but only if you don’t reuse anything from before.</li>
</ul>
<p>This combination makes your return to Discord undetectable and helps avoid chain bans on future accounts.</p>

<h2>Tips for Success</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Don’t invite old friends or join banned servers right away — that’s how new accounts get flagged.</li>
    <li>Avoid using the same device name or Discord tag as before.</li>
    <li>Consider using a different device or fresh OS install if bans keep coming back.</li>
    <li>If you’re IP-banned but not account banned, logging in from a new network is often enough.</li>
    <li>Use browser privacy extensions if accessing Discord via web to block future tracking cookies.</li>
</ul>

<p>By following this method, you can cleanly bypass a Discord IP ban and avoid instant reflags. Stay subtle, and you’ll stay unbanned.</p>
